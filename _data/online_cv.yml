personal_profile: |
  Hi! I'm James, a Software Engineer at Starling Bank (Cardiff, Wales). I have previously worked for
  Capgemini, DVLA, IBM, Admiral Group, Sorenson Media and the Alcumus group. I have a wide experience of full stack
  development in both large and small scale systems. I have worked for small startups, large global
  organisations, UK government critical national infrastructure (CNI) and financial service technologies. 
  I mainly work in Java and Javascript but have experience in a wide range of languages and technologies, including 
  Ruby, Go, Python, Kubernetes, AWS, Serverless applications, Docker &  K8s many more.

      At Starling I am a member of the Account Management engineering group which looks after all things customer accounts,
      core customer records, transactions and more. Pretty much everything that happens in the bank will at some point
      touch a service within Account Management (AM). I work as a senior-level IC in a team which acts as a drop-in team for any
      and all bits of work within the bank which may not fall into distinct product categories, resulting in a workday which
      is varied, ever-evolving and extremely rewarding. The tech stack is as follows:
      
      * Java 21, with the only "framework" being Guice for DI and IoC
      * Docker & K8s for services in environments
      * Postgres DB in RDS & Cloud SQL
      * AWS & GCP for cloud
      * TeamCity & GH Actions for CI pipelines
      * GitHub for all code
      
      Starling truly do follow an "engineering focussed" mentality with Engineering having significant freedom and trust
      to "do the right thing" (one of Starling's core values). The team has no scrum masters, no sprints, no Jira tickets
      and definitely no time tracking! It's been a breath of fresh air and an employer I wholeheartedly recommend.

      Within Capgemini, I worked within the Custom Software Development (CSD) practice, in
      which I was embedded within HMRC. I led a "pod" of 4 teams working on the Enterprise Integration 
      Services (EIS) platform. Additionally, I was a “DevOps Champion” and led many
      of the improvement initiatives in play. The tech stack consisted of:
      
      * Java microservices running Spring Boot & Apache Camel.
      * Kubernetes based infrastructure using Rancher, Helm and Teraform.
      * AWS underlying infrastructure supporting all services.
      * BDD tests written in Cucumber/Gherkin syntax.
      * GitLab CI/Jenkins for CI/CD functionality.
     
      As Capgemini is a  consultancy, I also then additionally wore a second hat on the 
      corporate side, where I acted as a people manager and assignment manager for up to 15 people 
      and was heavily involved in initiatives such as our internal Java Academy, strategic 
      direction decisions relating to client contracts and standard setting across 
      the Capgemini business.

      * Used Scala and Go to work on Play Framework and Drone plugins respectively.
      * Mentoring team members and representing the squad at many cross squad discussions.
      * Actively involved with many cross government communities and chats, including security, design
        and software engineering standards.
