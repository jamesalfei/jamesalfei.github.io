Hello! My name is James Alfei. I'm a senior software engineer working for the UK Driver and Vehicle 
Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea, Wales.

I have a love for all things technology and fintech and fix computers in my spare time.

On this website, I'll keep a list of projects I've worked on and companies I've worked with.

If you'd like to get in contact with me about anything, my contact details can be found
on the page footer, on in the [online CV]({%- link pages/online-cv.md -%}).
